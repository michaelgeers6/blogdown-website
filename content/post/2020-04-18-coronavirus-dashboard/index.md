This is my version of a Coronavirus dashboard, designed entirely using
the data visualization tool Tableau. The dark theme and layout is
obviously inspired by the well-know dashboards provided by the [Robert
Koch-Institut](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/478220a4c454480e823b17327b2bf1d4)
respectively the [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource
Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

The data dataset is drawn from three different sources: - SARS-CoV-2
data provided by the [JHU
CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19), - Population data
provided by [The World
Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.pop.totl) for the year
2018, - Governmental intervention data provided by
[ACAPS](https://www.acaps.org/covid19-government-measures-dataset).
Thanks to [Joachim
Gassen](https://joachim-gassen.github.io/2020/03/merge-covid-19-data-with-governmental-interventions-data/)
for this additional idea.

The data in `R` and cleaned using the tools provided in `tidyverse`
R-package collection. Country names are standardized using the
regex-parser implemented in the `passport` R-package. In addition to the
features contained in the merged dataset, the following features have
been generated: - `Total Closed Cases`, `Total Active Cases`, -
`Incremental Confirmed Cases`, `Incremental Recovered Cases`,
`Incremental Dead Cases`, `Incremental Closed Cases`,
`Incremental Active Cases`, - the `log` of each all total and
incremental termed features, - the `Infection-Recovery-Ratio` computed
as `Total Confirmed Cases` over `Total Recovered Cases`, - the
`Recovery-Death-Ratio` computed as `Total Recovered Cases` over
`Total Dead Cases`, - the `Active-Closed-Ratio` computed as
`Total Active Cases` over `Total Closed Cases`, - the version of the
case fatality rate (CFR) computed as the `Total Dead Cases` relative to
the `Total Confirmed Cases` (*CFR1*), the sum of `Total Recovered Cases`
and `Total Dead Cases` (*CFR2*) respectively `Total Confirmed Cases` at
`t-8` (*CFR3*) with eight assumed to be the average incubation period
and - the `Doubling Time` of the `Total Confirmed Cases` in days.

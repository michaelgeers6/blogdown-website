I am a PhD student intrigued by research at the intersection between data science and accounting. After having explored different facets of data science (e.g., text mining and predictive modelling) in the context of accounting and finance at the [*Münster School of Business and Economics*](https://www.wiwi.uni-muenster.de/fakultaet/en) and [*Copenhagen Business School*](https://www.cbs.dk/en), I envision to contribute to the field with the principles of open science in mind.

During my time as a student research assistant at [*Research Team Berens*](https://www.wiwi.uni-muenster.de/ctrl/), I gained experience in experimental design, data collection, statistical modelling and Monte Carlo simulation in R and taught classes in management accounting, operations research and SQL. Besides, I worked as an intern at Miele, BASF as well as Bayer. I supported and worked on multiple projects within the accounting domain and gained hands-on experience in working with operational data from prevalent accounting information systems using R and Tableau.
